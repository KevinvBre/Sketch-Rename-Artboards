# Rename Artboards for Sketch.
_Rename Artboards based on their X and Y locations in Sketch_

I kept going mental when renaming artboards to be clean and understandable for exports in Zeplin, Jira or Dropbox. And I wanted to impress the next designer to open document with my 'dedication to neatly renaming artboards skills'. My Sketch pages are named like for function groups like `A - Homepage`, story numbers `ABC-1234` or `Archived`.

### This plugin does this
- Add a prefix to the arboard name. The plugin keeps everything before the first space in the page name. So the prefix will be something like this `A`, `ABC-1234` or `Archived`.
- Automatically number them. Row 0 artboard 0, Row 0 Artboard 1. Etc etc.
- Re-arrange their list order in Sketch.
- Remove the 'Copy 19' tags. (other plugins do this but now I can delete those or skip a shortcut)
- Maintain the original artboard name.

### I didn't need this / stuff this plugin does NOT do.
- Find and replace stuff for layer names.
- Re-positions the artboards in a neet way. Use this [Artboard Manager](https://github.com/bomberstudios/artboard-manager)

So if you actually read all that. You noticed that this plugin was build for a specific group of people. Those who use [Artboard Manager](https://github.com/bomberstudios/artboard-manager) and also like structure in their page names.

Enjoy!
