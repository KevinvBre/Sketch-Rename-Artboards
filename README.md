# Line 2 Rect for Sketch.
_Convert every new line into a rectangle, no more 0.5 pixels or weird scaling._

Since 0.5/half pixels don't exist its kinda weird to design using them. Sketch inserts its lines on 0.5 pixels by default. That's what I don't like. I do however like the line tools ability to quickly draw a line! So I decided to write a plugin that replaces every new line by a rectangle.
The best of both worlds! Or as the Dutch say `"van twee walletjes eten!"`.

Enjoy!
